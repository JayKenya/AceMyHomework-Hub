					  			  <!-- wp:heading -->
						<h5><strong>How does this custom writing service work?</strong></h5>
						<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
						<p>To learn more about how <a href="index.html">Acemyhomework</a> works, feel free to visit the ‘Work Flow’ page. On this page, you will get a more comprehensive explanation regarding our features, what we offer, how to acquire the services, and also what to expect from us.&nbsp;
						<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
						</p><h5><strong>Who writes the papers?</strong></h5>
						<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
						<p>We have a team of real unemployed professors who have been carefully selected to handle your work. These professors are graduates from very notable institutions from across the globe who have chosen to offer students homework help. They are trained and skilled in tackling essays and other academic papers of any kind. They have over a decade of experience and are holders of masters, degrees, and even doctoral. They are versatile and can tackle essays under any discipline. They continually polish their citation styles, writing skills, and editing skills to ensure that you get only the best and most authentic piece.
						<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
						</p><h5><strong>Do you charge for revisions, and do you offer refunds?</strong></h5>
						<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
						<p>Unlike most writing services, we do not charge for our revisions. We always provide free amendments if need be. We have had to do a review for almost less than a quarter of all of our custom papers. It goes to show how much consideration we place in the research, writing, and editing phase of our custom papers. We do not offer refunds. However, we do offer free revisions whenever a writer does not produce a document matching the requirements of your assignment.<br><br></p>
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					<h5>How do I fill in the order form?</h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>Our website is quite easy to navigate, which makes filling in the order form straightforward. On the main page of our website, you will see an order form. Go ahead and click on the Get it Done button to start filling out. After you fill out this short order form, click on ‘Continue’ to be directed to a more detailed form. At this juncture, if you do not have an account with us, one will automatically be created. You will then get a password sent to your email address. The password can be reset any time after you place an order. Feel free to use a combination of digits and signs that cannot easily be hacked. After this, you will be directed to a more comprehensive form. This form requires you to provide specifics about your assignment. It asks for details such as the paper deadline, number of pages, the formatting style, and other essential requirements for your task.
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5><strong>How quickly can I get my paper?</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>Our real unemployed professors have been trained to meet any deadline. Whether it is a few hours or days, Writers Hub will always manage to beat your deadline. So no matter what timeframe you select, 3 hours, 2 hours, one day, by noon, or two days, you can be confident that you will get your document then.
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5>How can I send my sources or materials to the writer?</h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>There is a segment that allows you to provide any information you want to be used in your article. It could be a source, a draft, a screenshot of instructions, a reading material, an image, or an outline. This section is situated in the part of filling out the order form.
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5><strong>Is the information I provide to your website secure?&nbsp;</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>YES. Your information is 100 percent secure. We usually store that specific information behind a highly secure firewall that has the latest standards of encryption. We have strict policies about the privacy and security of the personal data of our clients, and we do not waver from them. We never reveal your information to a third party or sell it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5>What happens in case I forget my password?</h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>If you forget your password, please click on the link titled ‘Forgot Password.’ You can find it below the ‘Login’ button situated on the login page of our website.
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5><strong>How am I sure that the work I have received is original?</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>After we write any paper, we use software known as Copyscape to check for the plagiarism and authenticity level. This is a reliable online plagiarism detection tool. We have been using time every time after editing, to ensure that all the documents we submit to you are 100% plagiarism free and 100% original. We have strict policies in our firm that insist on anti-plagiarism. Thus, be guaranteed authentic manuscripts from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5>What is the formatting style of your custom papers?</h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>Our real unemployed professors are skilled in writing in various writing styles. These include formatting styles such as Chicago / Turabian, Harvard referencing style, AMA, MLA, APA, and many more. They are highly qualified, and they always follow the rules of all these writing styles. You do not have to worry about having a title page or reference page being formatted in the wrong style because our expert writers have specialized in these formatting styles for decades. In case you do not require a formatting style used in your paper, please click on the ‘Not applicable’ option to ensure your document is submitted as a plain Microsoft Word document.
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5>Is it free to place an order with Us?</h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

You get the opportunity to first see the profile of Writers Hub, before deciding on who will tackle your order. Please feel free to ask for a draft or an outline to the writer you think best suits your assignment.

					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5><strong>Can the writers handle any topic?&nbsp;</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

					</p><h5><strong>Why should I use your company and not the other writing websites?&nbsp;</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>There are so many writing firms that a student can opt to use when they are searching for homework solutions. However, the truth of the matter is that they are not like us when it comes to quality, authenticity, and reliability.We strive to build and maintain our status, which is very high at the moment. Unlike other writing firms, we strive to provide top-notch and original work on time. We care about the academic success of our clients, and for this, I insist you trust us with your work. The best way to discover why we are the best in the market is to give us a try and see our fantastic results.&nbsp;
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5><strong>What happens if I do not get my paper on time?</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>&nbsp;It is sporadic that you will get such a disservice from us. Never in the history of our existence have we ever submitted the work of a client past the scheduled time. We give urgent papers high priority to ensure that the writers can provide these papers full attention to ensure they are completed on time. If a writer is not able to complete a lengthier task on time, we utilize the services of another writer who is skilled in the same area of interest. This ensures that you get your paper before the due date. However, if by any chance you do not get your paper on time, you will get a FULL REFUND of your payment.
					<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
					</p><h5><strong>What happens if I am not satisfied with my paper?&nbsp;</strong></h5>
					<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
					<p>&nbsp;The primary goal of our website is to ensure that every client is satisfied with the homework help they acquire from us. Therefore, if, by any chance, you are not pleased with the work you have received from us, which is very rare, we do offer free revisions. The revisions will help you acquire a paper that matches your preferences, and one that meets all the instructions of the assignment. We are available 24/7, and you can, therefore, contact us anytime to get an amendment.
