It is mainly examined by school admission boards such as colleges and high schools. Scholars are expected to showcase why they deserve admission; hence the paper needs to be well-thought-out and presented.</p><p>Ideally, all individuals are unique, and when tasked with this essay, students need to think of reasons that make them stand out. Whereas you should share facts when writing the article, you need to think of remarkable things. Remember, normal is boring, and you are competing against thousands of applicants. Therefore, think creatively. After all, you want to capture your readers' attention.</p><p>Some great taglines when writing who am I college essay include:</p><ul><li>I am confident of my attention to detail skills.</li><li>I believe I'm an empath, and I would bring value to your community service projects.</li><li>I am passionate about extra-curricular activities, and I even presented my high school in the Texas Annual Regional Swimming Gala.</li><li>I want to become a seasoned journalist, and joining this school would help me achieve my ambition.</li><li>Growing up in foster care has given me so much hope in getting a good education, and all I want is to make my parents proud when I finally graduate from university and get a job.</li></ul><p><strong>Who Am I Essay Format</strong></p><p>Considering this essay is a deal-breaker for many application statuses, students need to give it their best shot.

I never made friends, and people would refer to me as the lone ranger. They never knew how much my esteem got bruised every time they made fun of my personality. If only one person would try to understand me from a deeper perspective, I believe I wasn't a bad person.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Seeing my dad drunk and abusive to both mom and me damaged me in every ounce of my being. I was such a wreck, and my hatred for men was impeccable. I would always wonder why our neighbours said or did nothing whenever we shouted for help. In return, my hatred continued to develop for not just men but society. By the time I was joining an elementary school, my human touch had been broken, and all I knew was to fight for what I wanted. This always got me reprimanded all the time.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>My esteem was so shaken, and by the time I rediscovered a better life, I had been laughed at, bullied and even orchestrated. Gladly today, I am a motivational speaker, and I always urge people to be their brother's keeper. Don't ever judge people based on what you see. It'd be a lot nicer to show kindness to people. You never know how much it means until you learn the burden that people carry with them.</i></p><p><i><strong>Example 2</strong></i></p><p><i>I went through difficult situations as a student in my former years in senior school, but I learned how to overcome them. Being in the last position in class and your parents being called for improvement meetings was not always easy. Although my parents kept encouraging me, I was always so hard on myself. What I didn't know at that time was that progress takes time.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Yes, I'd improve from a D to a D+, but I kept telling myself that it was never good enough. When I got to the C, I wanted a B. I did manage to get an award for the most-improved student. But looking back, I wish I appreciated myself every time I made a small win. I have learned that growth is steady, and we should be kind to ourselves in every situation as we excel for better grades.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Who am I essay is one of the most straightforward assignments.
