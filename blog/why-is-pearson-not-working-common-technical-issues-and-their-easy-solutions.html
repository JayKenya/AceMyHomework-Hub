These challenges can make you ask the question “is Pearson offline”, because of the inability to access the programs.</p><p>One of the main technical challenges faced by Pearson online users is the need for a strong and reliable internet connection. In addition, users must also have a compatible browser and device. While these requirements may seem basic, they can be difficult to meet in some parts of the world.

Fortunately, there is a workaround that should allow you to continue accessing your assignments without any issues.
