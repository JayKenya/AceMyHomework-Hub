Gather All the Relevant Study Materials</h4><p>Before settling down to study, ensure you have all the study materials. Compile all the notes and books, a notebook and paper to jot down the points as you study. Having everything ready will help you keep the momentum of your study.</p><h4>2. Turn off Social Media</h4><p>Social media is a counterproductive distraction. It is also electronic ADHD since it will sink a cram session. Neither will a social media star tweet anything that will help you score better in your test.</p><p>So, take a break and prioritize your cram session. You will be surprised by how much you will cover within a limited period.</p><h4>3. Study in a Conducive Environment</h4><p>Where you study from is equally important. Some people prefer a quiet room like a library, while others are comfortable studying in a coffee shop. Do what works for you.</p><h4>4. Eat a Healthy Meal</h4><p>Did you know what you eat influences the effectiveness of how you retain information? So, if you are looking for tips on how to cram for a Math test, consider taking brain foods like salmon, blueberries, nuts, to mention a few.</p><h4>5. Turn On a Timer</h4><p>A cram session is time-sensitive. Therefore, tracking how much time you spend cramming a concept will determine how much you will cover at the end of the session.</p><p>However, for a practical cram session, consider the 50/10 rule. Studying for 6 hours straight is most likely not going to be beneficial. The 50/10 recommends studying for 50 minutes and resting for 10 minutes. The rule makes cramming fun. Setting a timer will help you establish a rhythm.</p><h4>6. Get Enough Sleep Before Cram Studying</h4><p>Getting a good night's sleep before the cramming session is vital. A well-rested mind is more likely to be alert for long hours. It is also likely to retain more information.</p><h4>7. Make Your Study Guide</h4><p>Coming up with a study guide is a significant hack in cram studying. While writing it out or reading it, involve all your senses. That way, you will retain information better.</p><h4>8. Focus On the Main Concepts and Ideas</h4><p>Cramming means that the shelf-life of the information you are trying to grasp is limited. Therefore, mastering the main concepts is the main focus if you are looking for tips on how to cram for a Math test.</p><p>So, look out for headings, explanations to main ideas, dates, events, vocabulary and equations.</p><h4>9. Use the Chunking Technique</h4><p>While it is advisable to focus on the main points, you are likely to leave out essential concepts that you ought to have gone through. The chunking technique will help you avoid this. Therefore, creating a list, line diagram, or flashcards with a list of the related ideas will come in handy. This technique will help you keep track of what you have covered.</p><h4>10. Study With Friends</h4><p>Some people find it easier to study with friends. Others consider it a distraction. Choose what works for you.</p><h4>11. Do a Light Run-Through</h4><p>This has to be the point where the rubber meets the road. Soaking up on loads of information is one thing, and your brain retaining it is another. So, evaluate yourself to determine how much you remember. You could use flashcards for this.</p><h4>12. Involve All Your Senses While Cram Studying</h4><p>How do you cram for a test in one day? One effective way of cramming when you have limited time is involving all your senses. It helps you stay focused and takes away the anxiety of running out of time. However, ensure to do this at home.</p><h4>13. Set Goals, Milestones and Rewards</h4><p>Studying or cramming for a test is not as fun. However, rewards are the motivation everyone needs during the process. You could have the rewards after hitting a set milestone or goal.</p><p>Is cramming for a test effective? Cramming for a test is effective if you employed these tips and were focused and intentional about the process. It is better than not taking the chance and failing the exam.
