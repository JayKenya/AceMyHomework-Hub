                        <p>The Sims 4 is a strategic life simulation video game that gives you total control over the life of your Sim. You get to create their look and personality and even have the freedom to make a family. When your sim family expands and have young ones when they reach their teenage years, you have to start paying more attention to their grades in school.</p><p>When thinking about gaming, homework is probably the last thing that crosses your mind. But in Sims 4, getting it right with your homework is crucial to becoming a successful scholar. It’s also fundamental with the parenting skill and could impact your Sims’ lifetime in several ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’re raising a family or organizing study sessions between dormitory parties, homework skills are a must in the Sims 4 game – and there’s more to it than you can ever imagine. This detailed guide will help you complete your homework and other related tasks in Sims 4.</p><h3><strong>Why Does&nbsp;Sims Homework&nbsp;Matter?</strong></h3><p>Just like the adult Sims that they turn out to be, kids have skills to increase the play level. These include social, mental, motor, and creativity skills.</p><p>While you must increase one of these to level two for the Sim to achieve a B, it’s well worth it to take time and mix some of the skills. When you get to level ten with any childhood skill, your Sim will boost their&nbsp;Sims 4 homework&nbsp;completion rate by 70%. Maxing all for will create a 280% boost.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, each skill max lets you access several adult skills, giving your child an adult development head start.</p><h3><strong>How Do I Make My Child Do Homework On Sims?</strong></h3><p>It may be slightly confusing when the children in your Sims 4 family eventually reach the homework age.
